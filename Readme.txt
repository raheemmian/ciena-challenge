Welcome to my challenge, I completed the challenge plus the first 4 bonus points using Pythons Django framework.

Please make sure to have the latest python version installed, I used Python 3.9.5.

Pull the code, or download the zip. 

Create and activate your virtual environment:
Here are some relevant guides.
Windows users guide: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
Mac users guide: https://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/Python/virtualenv.html

To get the necessary dependencies run: pip install -r requirements.txt in the main directory.

To start the server run: py manage.py runserver

After running your command line should look something like this: 

Django version 3.2.3, using settings 'ciena.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Copy the development server link into ur browser: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

The web app should be up and running now, Have fun!

Start: This button will start the acquisition untill the Stop button is pressed.
